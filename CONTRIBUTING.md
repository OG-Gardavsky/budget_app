# Contributing
First of all setup your enviroment as described in [README](https://github.com/OG-Gardavsky/budget_app/blob/main/README.md)

If you wish to contribute first look into the opened [issues](https://github.com/OG-Gardavsky/budget_app/issues), or you can think up anything else.

When you finish your code, before you create a new pull request make sure that:
- your code does not include any node modules
- there is not a 'dist' folder in the client folder
